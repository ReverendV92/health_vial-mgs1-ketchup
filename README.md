### Metal Gear Solid Ketchup Bottle for HL2 Health Vial
Who needs Combine health vials ~~juice boxes~~ when you can shotgun an entire bottle of ketchup? 
Can be used to heal, or to play dead to fool unsuspecting guards with IBS. Does not fool Combine.
Replaces the HL2 health vial with Otacon's ketchup bottle from MGS1.
